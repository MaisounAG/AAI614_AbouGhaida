    "A *Jupyter Notebook* is based on a client-server application that allows users to create, edit, and run notebooks via a **web browser**. A *notebook* is an executable document that is used for interactive development.  *Jupyter Notebook* runs on a computer (Linux, MacOS, or Windows) without Internet access.  It can be also installed on a remote server where it can accessed through the Internet.  A Jupyter Notebook is an essential tool that is being used by data scientists and machine learning engineers.  It is essentiual that you get get accustomed with the various commands in Jupyter prior to embarking on coding in Python for data science.   Let us walk thorugh these commands and see how this can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Jupyter Notebook* has two main components: the kernels and the dashboard.  The **kernel** is a program that runs and introspects the user’s code. In our case, the kernel will interpret Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.  The **dashboard** shows the notebook documents that we create.  "

    "A code cell contains actual code that we would like to execute.  We can either specify a cell as a *code cell* using the pulldown menu in the toolbar  or using the the short cut is **Esc - y**.  A code is executed by hitting Enter while holding down the Shift key (denoted **Shift + Enter**).  Code cells are executed in the order we **Shift+Enter** them. A markdown cell uses **markdown** which is a lightweight Markup language with a plain text syntax that was developed by John Gruber in 2004.  Markdown is designed to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible.  In fact, this cell uses markup.  We will not be able to go over the markdown language at length but it is recommended that you do.  Let us see an example on how we use *code cells* and *markdown cells.*"

    "## Running External Code: ``%run``\n",
    "As you begin developing more extensive code, you will likely find yourself working in both IPython for interactive exploration, as well as a text editor to store code that you want to reuse.\n",
    "Rather than running this code in a new window, it can be convenient to run it within your IPython session.\n",
    "This can be done with the ``%run`` magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you've created a ``myscript.py`` file with the following contents:\n",

    "    print(N, \"squared is\", square(N))\n",

    "2 squared is 4\n",
